I'm not moved by anything
Don't wanna move for anything
'Cos it could be just anything
That starts me moving
And when I move
I won't stop for anything
Stop for anything
Why build me up
Just to tear me down
Why pick you up
Just to throw you down
'cos it could be just anything
That starts me moving
I don't just waste my time
I waste everything inside
