[00:13.36] I rushed home from work like I always do.
[00:23.75] I spent my whole day just thinking of you.
[00:33.24] When I walked through the front door, my whole life was changed
[00:43.50] 'Cause nobody answered when I called your name.
[01:07.00] 
[00:56.26] A note on the table that told me goodbye
[01:06.52] Said you'd grown weary of living a lie.
[01:16.47] Oh, your love has ended, but mine still remains
[01:27.03] But nobody answers when I call your name.
[01:47.53] 
[01:39.38] Oh, the lonely sound of my voice calling
[01:50.21] Is driving me insane.
[02:00.44] And just like rain, the tears keep falling
[02:10.62] But nobody answers when I call your name.
[02:31.12] 
[03:06.31] Oh, the lonely sound of my voice calling
[03:17.16] Is driving me insane.
[03:27.26] And just like rain, the tears keep falling
[03:37.45] But nobody answers when I call your name.
[03:47.51] Oh, nobody answers when I call your name.
