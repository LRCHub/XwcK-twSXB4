One of these days when I retire from this life
There'll be no more heartache, there'll be no more strife
It's just across the river in a land so fair
It's a place they call Hallelujah Square
When I move
Move to Hallelujah Square
All my loved ones gonna wait for me there
And then I'll never have a burden to bare
When I move to Hallelujah Square
Yeah when I move to Hallelujah Square
There'll be no sorrow, there'll be no more pain
The weather never changes, it's always the same
I'll never have a burden, never have a care
When I move to a place called Hallelujah Square
When I move
Move to Hallelujah Square
All my loved ones gonna wait for me there
And then I'll never have a burden to bare
When I move to Hallelujah Square
Yeah when I move to Hallelujah Square
(Instrumental)
When I move
Move to Hallelujah Square
All my loved ones gonna wait for me there
And then I'll never have a burden to bare
When I move to Hallelujah Square
Yeah when I move to Hallelujah Square

Yeah when I move to Hallelujah Square
