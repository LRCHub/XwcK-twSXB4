[00:05.13] The only time I feel the pain
[00:10.82] Is in the sunshine or the rain
[00:15.06] And I don't feel no hurt at all
[00:18.53] Unless you count when teardrops fall
[00:22.57] I tell the truth 'cept when I lie
[00:26.50] It only hurts me when I cry
[00:40.00] 
[00:30.40] You couldn't tell it by the smile
[00:33.76] That my recovery took awhile
[00:37.59] I worked for days and nights on end
[00:41.60] Just to walk and talk again
[00:45.26] You can't believe the time it takes
[00:49.04] To heal a heart once it breaks
[01:04.04] 
[00:54.35] The only time I feel the pain
[00:56.74] Is in the sunshine or the rain
[01:01.04] And I don't feel no hurt at all
[01:04.89] Unless you count my teardrops fall
[01:08.85] I tell the truth 'cept when I lie
[01:12.51] It only hurts me when I cry
[01:26.01] 
[01:28.88] Oh maybe every now and then
[01:34.92] I have a small heartache again
[01:38.92] You wouldn't know when you look at me
[01:42.75] There's tiny scars that you can't see
[01:46.77] It was a struggle to survive
[01:50.97] I'm probably lucky I'm alive
[02:04.97] 
[01:55.89] The only time I feel the pain
[01:58.49] Is in the sunshine or the rain
[02:02.42] And I don't feel no hurt at all
[02:06.22] Unless you count when teardrops fall
[02:10.29] I tell the truth 'cept when I lie
[02:14.28] And it only hurts me when I cry
[02:29.78] 
[02:18.51] I tell the truth 'cept when I lie
[02:21.71] And it only hurts me when I cry
