[00:11.53] I've never done anything
[00:18.41] That would ever bring a tear to your eye
[00:26.17] I've never crossed the line
[00:29.89] Or needed an alibi to cover up a lie
[00:47.89] 
[00:38.00] But darlin' I'll admit
[00:43.89] They're been times when I could have
[00:49.12] The thing that kept me strong
[00:51.53] Is the one thing that is always on my mind
[01:12.53] 
[00:58.88] When I think about cheatin'
[01:04.95] I just think about you leavin'
[01:10.64] And how my world would fall to pieces
[01:16.41] If I tossed your love away
[01:20.49] Even when I'm tempted by some stranger
[01:26.42] Oh, there's never any danger
[01:32.08] I just think about you leavin'
[01:38.75] When I think about cheatin'
[01:52.25] 
[01:47.32] There was a time in Abilene
[01:49.91] When he said all the things I wanted to hear
[01:58.92] It was hard to turn him down
[02:02.39] Between the champagne and the sound of whispers in my ear
[02:30.89] 
[02:10.07] But it just took one
[02:14.05] Two-step with someone and I was missing you
[02:22.84] He never had a chance 'cause I broke up the dance
[02:29.61] Before the song was through
[02:43.11] 
[02:34.16] When I think about cheatin'
[02:40.20] I just think about you leavin'
[02:45.78] And how my world would fall to pieces
[02:52.06] If I tossed your love away
[02:56.38] Even when I'm tempted by some stranger
[03:01.74] Oh, there's never any danger
[03:07.98] I just think about you leavin'
[03:14.32] When I think about cheatin'
[03:27.82] 
[03:19.95] And when I'm tempted by some stranger
[03:26.16] Oh, there's never any danger
[03:32.21] I just think about you leavin'
[03:38.65] When I think about cheatin'
